## 🐾 About The Project

I've been studying other ways to handle errors without having to throw all the time and I found the Either pattern which is quite famous, so I've given it a try.

The **[Umbriel](https://github.com/diego3g/umbriel)** project helped me to study and made things clearer about where I should go, so I find it's good to mention it.
